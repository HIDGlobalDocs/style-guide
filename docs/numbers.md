# Numbers

## Using numbers in text

Follow these guidelines when using numbers in text.

When you write about numbers that appear in a UI, duplicate them exactly as the UI displays.

### Using numerals

In general, use numerals for numbers in text, even for numbers less than 10. This includes numbers associated with counts, dates, decimals, fractions, measurements, percentages, ranges, time, versions, weight, numbers with 4 or more digits, and other data for comparison or analysis.

Review the following table for examples of when to use numerals in text:

| **Use numerals for** | **Example** | **For more information** |
|---|---|---|
| Counts | 2 forwarders, 3 unique values | |
| Dates | April 22, 2019 | See [Dates](#dates). |
| Decimals | 3.14 | See [Commas and decimals](#commas-and-decimals). |
| Dimensions | 1280 x 1024 | |
| Distance | 4 feet | |
| Duration of time | 2 minutes | See [Time](#time). |
| Fractions | 1/4 | See [Fractions](#fractions). |
| Measurements | 8 CPU, 1,045 MB | See [Measurements](#measurements). |
| Numerical user input | In the **Number** field, enter 5. | |
| Percentages | 25% | |
| Phone numbers | +1-888-555-1212 | See [Phone numbers](#phone-numbers). |
| Pixels | 450 px, 1920 x 1080 pixels | |
| Ranges | 50 to 60 GB | See [Ranges](#ranges). |
| Time of day | 2:30 PM to 5 PM | See [Time](#time). |
| Versions | HID Enterprise 7.x | See [Versions](#versions). |
| Weight 40 lbs | |

#### Don't start a sentence with a numeral

Avoid starting a sentence with a numeral. Instead, rewrite the sentence so the number comes later in the sentence or is prefaced by a modifier. If you can't rewrite the sentence, spell out the number at the beginning of the sentence.

Review the following table for examples of sentences that have been rewritten to follow these guidelines:

| **Original sentence** | **Rewritten sentence** |
|---|---|
| 4 peers are contained in this cluster. | This cluster contains 4 peers. |
| 11 hosts have unusually high CPU usage. | Eleven hosts have unusually high CPU usage. |

### When to spell out numbers

Numbers sometimes provide context or additional information without being the focus of the sentence. In such cases, spell out the number to emphasize what the number is describing rather than the number's numerical value.

Spell out ordinal numbers in text. See the following examples:

- Four types of lookups
- One of the following ranges
- Twelfth line in the code
- Third-party software

### Hyphenating numbers

Hyphenate both numerals and spelled-out numbers when they are part of a compound adjective. See the following examples:

- Two-factor authentication
- 128-bit number

### Examples of number usage

Review the following table for examples of correctly using numerals and spelling out numbers in text:

| **Correct usage** | **Incorrect usage** |
|---|---|
| Zero downtime | 0 downtime |
| Default value of 0 | Default value of zero |
| Follow these steps to move an app from one instance to another. | Follow these steps to move an app from 1 instance to another. |
| There are two kinds of field extractions. | There are 2 kinds of field extractions. |
| 1-, 2-, or 3-hour alerting intervals | One-, two-, or three-hour alerting intervals |

### Numbers in headings

It's okay to use a number in any level of heading if the number is part of a name. See the following examples:

- SPL2 stats and charting functions
- Create a DSP connection to get data from Amazon S3

It's okay to use numbers in a heading to indicate steps or parts in a tutorial. Otherwise, don't use numbers in any level of heading to indicate a sequence or multiple tasks on a single page. If you want to show the order of tasks, use a supertask instead.

| **Correct as H1s on separate pages in a tutorial** | **Incorrect as H2s on a single page of a task** |
|---|---|
| Step 1: Getting started<br>Step 2: Activate your pipeline | 1. Register an app<br>2. Add permissions |

For more information about naming your headings, see [Name your topic or sections](titles-and-headings.md#name-your-topic-or-sections).

## Dates

When writing about numbers that appear in a HID product UI, duplicate them exactly as the UI displays. Otherwise, follow these guidelines.

Use numerals for numbers associated with dates. Spell out the day of the week and the month. Don't use ordinals, such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on. See the following examples:

- April 22
- Monday, April 22
- Monday, April 22, 2019
- April 2019

## Commas and decimals

When writing about numbers that appear in a HID UI, duplicate them exactly as the UI displays. Otherwise, follow these guidelines.

Use standard American-style formatting for commas and decimal points in numbers.

### Commas

When writing numerals that are 4 or more digits long, use commas to set off groups of 3 digits. See the following examples:

- 1,852,762
- 2,000

### Decimals

When writing numerals with a decimal, use a period for the decimal point and include up to 2 decimal places. For an amount less than 1, use a leading 0 before the decimal point.

See the following examples:

- 0.05
- 3.14

## Fractions

When writing about numbers that appear in a HID UI, duplicate them exactly as the UI displays. Otherwise, follow these guidelines.

### Generic fractions

If you're referring to a generic fraction and not one that refers back to a specific number, hyphenate the spelled-out fraction.

| **Correct** | **Incorrect** |
|---|---|
| The system parsed two-thirds of the events. | The system parsed 2/3rds of the events.<br>The system parsed 2/3 of the events. |

### Numerical fractions

Use numerals and forward slashes with no additional formatting to represent numerical fractions.

| **Correct** | **Incorrect** |
|---|---|
| 1/2<br>3/4 | ½<br>¾ |

Add a space and remove the hyphen between a whole number and fraction.

| **Correct** | **Incorrect** |
|---|---|
| 70 1/2 | 70½<br>70-½<br>70-1/2 |

## Measurements

When writing about numbers that appear in a HID UI, duplicate them exactly as the UI displays. Otherwise, follow these guidelines.

Use a numeral when quantifying a unit of measurement or a rate. Add a space between the numeral and the rate measurement. Use the word "per" to describe a volume measurement. See the following examples:

| **Correct** | **Incorrect** |
|---|---|
| 8 GB of memory<br>An 8 CPU, 16 GB memory machine can achieve 50 to 60 Mb per second throughput. | 8GB of memory<br>An 8 CPU, 16 GB memory machine can achieve 50 to 60 Mb/second throughput. |

It's okay to abbreviate a unit of measurement in text. Ensure that you use the correct capitalization of the unit of measurement that you're referring to.

For example, use a capital "B" when referring to a multiple of the unit byte and a lowercase "b" when referring to a multiple of the unit bit. Review the following table for the correct capitalization of these units of measurement:

| **Unit** | **Abbreviation** |
|---|---|
| gigabit | Gb |
| gigabyte | GB |
| gigahertz | GHz |
| kibibyte | KiB |
| kilobit | Kb |
| kilobyte | KB |
| megabit | Mb |
| megabyte | MB |
| petabit | Pb |
| petabyte | PB |
| tebibyte | TiB |
| terabit | Tb |
| terabyte | TB |

## Phone numbers

When you write out a telephone number, start with the country code preceded by a plus ( + ) sign. Use dashes to separate numbers in the phone number. Don't use parentheses or periods to separate the numbers.

See the following examples:

- +1-555-555-0100
- +61-2-5550-9988

For information on creating fictitious example phone numbers in your docs, see [Example names and domains](grammar-and-word-choice.md#example-names-and-domains).

## Ranges

When writing about numbers that appear in a HID UI, duplicate them exactly as the UI displays. Otherwise, follow these guidelines.

Use numerals when referring to numbers in a range. Use a suitable word, such as "to", "from", or "through", instead of a hyphen between numbers in a range. Indicating a range with a suitable word removes any ambiguity that using a hyphen can create for readers who use screen readers.

!!! note

    It's okay to use a hyphen between numbers where space is a limiting factor, such as in a table or in tight UI spaces.

See the following examples:

- 50 to 60 GB
- 9 AM to 5 PM
- from 1 through 9

## Time

When writing about numbers that appear in a HID product UI, duplicate them exactly as the UI displays. Otherwise, follow these guidelines.

### Duration of time

Always use a numeral for numbers associated with duration of time. See the following examples:

- Change the default from 6 seconds to 60 seconds.
- Authentication expires after 2 hours.
- The instance remains active for 3 months.

Don't abbreviate units of time, such as seconds, hours, and months, in the documentation. You can abbreviate units of time in a HID product UI to save space. See Time in the UI text style guidelines.

### Time of day

Always use a number for numbers associated with time of day. See the following example:

- Office hours are from 6 AM to 5 PM.

### 12-hour clock

Use 12-hour time. For full hours, don't include the minutes. Capitalize AM and PM without using punctuation, and precede the time period with a space. See the following examples:

| **Correct** | **Incorrect** |
|---|---|
| 6 AM<br>2:30 PM | 06.00 hours<br>14 30 hours |

## Versions

When writing about numbers that appear in a HID UI, duplicate them exactly as the UI displays. Otherwise, follow these guidelines.

Use numerals for numbers associated with versions.

When referencing maintenance builds, minor versions, or releases for a product, use a lowercase "x" at the relevant place in the version name. Don't substitute "v" for version before the number. See the following examples:

- HID Enterprise 6.1.2
- HID Enterprise 7.x
- HID platform versions 6.6.x and 7.0.x
