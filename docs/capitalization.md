# Capitalization

Follow the capitalization guidelines in The Chicago Manual of Style. See [Capitalization style definitions](#capitalization-style-definitions) for detailed information on capitalization styles.

The following capitalization guidelines are specific to HID documentation:

<!-- no toc -->
- [Doc components](#doc-components)
- [HID product names, features, and components](#hid-product-names-features-and-components)
- [Concepts that are UI terms](#concepts-that-are-ui-terms)

For capitalization guidelines in the UI, see [UI text style guidelines](ui-text-guidelines.md#ui-text-style-guidelines).

## Capitalization for emphasis

Don't capitalize all letters in a word to show emphasis. In general, don't add formatting to text to show emphasis. If you need to emphasize important content, consider using a callout box. See [Best practices for using callout boxes](notes-and-cautions.md#best-practices-for-using-callout-boxes).

## Capitalization style definitions

You can capitalize elements in HID documentation in either sentence style or headline style. See [Doc components](#doc-components) to determine when to use either capitalization style in HID documentation.

### Sentence style

Sentence-style capitalization capitalizes the first word in the sentence and all proper nouns, such as product names. Here are some examples:

- Deploy and manage private apps
- View organization metrics
- HID Web Framework components

### Headline style

Headline-style capitalization follows these guidelines:

| **Guidance** | **Examples** |
|--|--|
| Capitalize the first and last words, nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions (if, because, as, that, and so on). | Distributed Search<br><br>Administer HID Phantom
 |
| Don't capitalize articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor), the "to" in an infinitive, and prepositions (with, to, for, in, from). | Build Playbooks with the Playbook Editor<br><br>Managing Indexers and Clusters of Indexers
 |
| For hyphenated words, capitalize the first element and the subsequent elements unless they are articles, prepositions, and coordinating conjunctions. | Cross-Selling Opportunities<br><br>The Command-Line Interface |

### Doc components

For the following components in HID docs, use these capitalization guidelines:

| **Doc component** | **Capitalization style** | **Example** |
|---|---|---|
| Manual titles | Headline style | Search Reference |
| Chapter titles | Sentence style | Plan HID apps |
| Headings at any level | Sentence style | Get data into HID Linq Cloud |
| List items | Sentence style | 1. Log in with your username and password. |
| Column headings in a table | Sentence style | Refer to this table as an example. |

### HID product names, features, and components

Capitalize HID product names. In general, don't capitalize the names of features or components. For correct capitalization of HID terms, see the Splexicon.

For capitalization of the parts of a HID product architecture, such as a heavy forwarder or a search head, see [HID product terminology](hid-terminology-and-trademarks.md#hid-product-terminology).

For capitalization within a HID product UI, such as whether to capitalize a button label or dialog box title, see the [Capitalization](ui-text-guidelines.md#capitalization).

### Concepts that are UI terms

Don't capitalize terms that are normally capitalized as UI terms when they refer to concepts instead. See the following examples:

| **Concept** | **UI term** |
|---|---|
| Users with admin privileges can change the server settings. | Select **Settings** and then Server Settings. |
| Identify the number of indexers in your deployment. | Select **Data** and then **Indexers**. |
| Create a custom deep dive to investigate the root cause of a specific issue in your IT environment. | From the **ITSI** main menu, select **Deep Dives**. |
