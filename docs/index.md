## The HID Tech Pubs Style Guide as a guide

All guidelines in the HID Tech Pubs Style Guide are exactly that: a guideline. The goal of the HID Tech Pubs Style Guide is to improve documentation by outlining places where consistency is important across docs, but there are scenarios where it might make sense to move away from these guidelines to make your documentation better. In every scenario, it's most important that you strive for clear, high-quality documentation.

The HID Tech Pubs Style Guide is a document in motion, so make sure you have pulled the latest changes if you wish to make updates.
