# Images

## Including images in HID docs

Images can enhance technical documentation when the product UI or workflow that you're describing is complex or difficult to understand. Use a screenshot, diagram, or GIF to clarify a process or accompany conceptual information. Use an inline image if a UI element is unclear.

In all cases, images must supplement written content. Don't use an image as a replacement for writing out a process or a concept.

All images must include surrounding and alternative text to assist users with visual impairments. For more information on making images accessible in HID docs, see [Images](accessibility.md#images).

### Types of images

You can use the following types of images in HID docs:

<!-- no toc -->
- [Screenshots](#screenshots)
- [Diagrams](#diagrams)
- [GIFs](#gifs)
- [Inline images](#inline-images)

### When to include an image

Consider using an image in the following circumstances:

- A workflow is difficult or complicated to process by words alone.
- You need to orient users to a screen that has many functional parts.
- You need to illustrate complex relationships among discrete parts of a product.
- You need to diagram or illustrate conceptual information.
- You need to illustrate several steps in a complex or intricate process.
- The UI requires complex interactions.
- The design of the UI or workflow isn't intuitive and you think users might need extra help.
- You need to supplement the name of a UI element in text with a visual aid from the UI.

#### Before you create an image

Before you create an image, follow these approaches:

- Consider whether you can use a table or list to convey information instead of a screenshot or diagram. For example, you can display forms, search results, or parts of a process in a table.
- Understand that the information you capture in an image might change in a future release. Consider whether you're able to update the image every time the UI or process changes as well as maintain the image for every release.
- Whenever possible, reuse an existing image instead of creating a new one. Consider whether you can use the same image for multiple steps or procedures.
- When you create a screenshot, capture the UI while using the light theme with your screen zoomed to 100%. If possible, don't capture the UI using the dark theme.
- When you use a screenshot from the UI, check that the image doesn't show sensitive information, like customer data or HID data.

#### After you create an image

After you place an image in your documentation, complete the following tasks:

1. Introduce each image with a full sentence that describes its contents.
2. Always include alt text with an image. See [Include alt text in images](accessibility.md#include-alt-text-in-images).
3. Make sure your images are accurate and up to date before release.

### When to avoid including an image

Avoid the following uses and types of images in your documentation:

- Don't include an image to replace or avoid writing an explanation about how to complete a task.
- Don't include a screenshot of the UI if the user can follow your written instructions without it. A well-designed UI doesn't need an accompanying screenshot in the documentation.
- Don't use photographs in your docs.
- Don't include an image if it contains customer data or HID data.

## Screenshots

You can use a screenshot to help users understand complicated UI workflows. Screenshots can be especially useful in content that is primarily task information, such as tutorials and scenarios, and in content for audiences who are new to the product. Screenshots are less useful in concept, reference, or troubleshooting information.

When you include a screenshot in your content, be sure to capture the UI while using the light theme with your screen zoomed to 100%.

This example shows a screenshot of the full width of the UI and its surrounding text:

When the package is uploaded successfully, it appears in the table on the Uploaded Apps page, shown in the following image. The app name and version appear only when the package passes all AppInspect checks and is approved.

## Diagrams

You can use a diagram to help users understand complex system architecture, task flows, processes, and conceptual information. Diagrams supplement your content, so don't replace your writing with a diagram. It's okay if a diagram has text in it.

See the following example of a simple diagram:

**_image_**

See the following example of a complex diagram:

**_image_**

This complex diagram uses color but doesn't rely on color to convey meaning. The lines use color in combination with different dash lengths so that readers who can't distinguish between colors can follow the path of the lines. A legend is included to identify each type of line.

## GIFs

You can use an animated GIF to show steps in a UI. Use an animated GIF to supplement task information or paragraph text, so don't remove essential text in favor of a GIF.

If a GIF requires a voiceover, is longer than 5 seconds in duration, or needs the ability to pause or skip ahead, use a video instead. See [Best practices for including videos](videos.md#best-practices-for-including-videos).

See the following example of an animated GIF:

## Inline images

You can use an inline image in a sentence to label a UI element, such as a toolbar icon or a button. See the following example of an inline image:
Select the settings icon (**_image_**) to show a list of settings.
