# dialog box, dialog, dialogue

Most of the time, avoid talking about UI elements. Talk about customer actions instead.

When you need to refer to a dialog box, use *dialog box*â€”don't shorten to *dialog.* Don't use *pop-up window* or *dialogue box*.

Don't hyphenate *dialog box* as a modifier.

## Examples

Word can't open this document because a dialog box is open. Close the dialog box to continue.  
Select the **Paragraph** dialog box launcher, and then select **Tabs**.   

**Exception** In content for developers, it's OK to use *dialog* by itself as a modifier. For example, "This article provides information about the dialog form pattern."

It's OK to use *dialogue* (not *dialog*) to refer to conversation or interaction between people or between a person and a computer. But use a more familiar, friendlier term such as *conversation* or *chat* if you can.

## Examples

It's a great way to have a conversation with the customer about what cloud technology can do for their business.  
Do you want to chat with a customer service agent?
