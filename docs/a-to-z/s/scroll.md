# scroll

Avoid. Use a verb phrase such as *move through* instead, if the context is clear.

It's OK to use *scroll*
in content that teaches beginning skills to describe
interacting with a document by using a mouse,
keyboard, or other peripheral device.

## Examples

Move through the folder until you see the file you want.  
Move the wheel button on the Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse to scroll up and down in a document.
