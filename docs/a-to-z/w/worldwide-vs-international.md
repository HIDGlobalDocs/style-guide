# worldwide vs. international

Use *worldwide* to describe something that encompasses all regions or involves the entire world.

## Examples

OneNote Mobile for Android is now available in more than 20 markets worldwide.

Use *international* to describe something that:

  - Involves two or more countries or regions.
  - Crosses national boundaries.

**Example**

Spain, and the United Kingdom and expanded certifications in seven other
