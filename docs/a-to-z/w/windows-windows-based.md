# Windows, Windows-based

Use *Windows* as a modifier for aspects or elements of the Windows operating system. Don't use *Windows-based*.

It's OK to use *Windows user* sparingly to avoid awkward constructions, but try to avoid *user* in general.

## Examples

Windows app  
Windows device  
the Windows Recycle Bin   
a device running Windows
