# rights

Use *rights*
only in a nonspecific way to refer to system actions that are
authorized by the system administrator. For specific references, use *user rights*.

Don't confuse *rights*, which apply to system operations, with *permissions*, which apply to specific system resources, such as files or printers.

Don't use *privileges* as a synonym for *rights*.

**Example**  
Domain administrators should use a primary user account, which has basic user rights in the domain.

**See also** [permissions](../p/permissions.md), [user rights](../u/user-rights.md)
