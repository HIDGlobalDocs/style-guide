# run vs. execute

Avoid *execute* except to follow the UI. Use *run* instead. If the UI includes *execute,* the resulting action is still *run*. 

Always use *run* in the context of operating systems, macros, and queries.

## Examples

To run the program, select **Execute**.  
Commands are run in the order in which they're listed in the file.
