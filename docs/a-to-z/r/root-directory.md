# root directory

In content for developers, use *root directory,* not *home directory,* to refer to the directory or folder from which all other directories or folders branch. In Windows, the root directory is indicated by a backslash (\\). Donâ€™t shorten to *root* when you mean the directory.

In other content, use *top-level folder*.

**Example**  
Change to the root directory, and enter the following command: **edit autoexec.bat**
