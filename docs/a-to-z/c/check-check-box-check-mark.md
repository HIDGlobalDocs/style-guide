# check, checkbox, check mark

Use *check mark* to refer to a mark placed next to an item to show it’s selected.

Use *checkbox*, not *box* or *check box*, to refer to a checkbox in UI. Avoid talking about UI elements. Instead, discuss what the user needs to do or what they're looking at.

Use *select* and *clear* with checkboxes, not *turn on* and *turn off*, *mark* and *unmark*, *check* and *uncheck*, or *select* and *deselect*.
