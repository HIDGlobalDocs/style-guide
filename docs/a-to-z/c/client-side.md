# client side, client-side

Don't use for a general audience. Use *client* instead.  

It's OK to use *client side* in writing for a technical audience when it refers specifically to the client part (side) of a program or protocol that acts on both a server computer and a client computer.

Avoid using *client-side* as an adjective. If you must use it as an adjective, hyphenate it.
