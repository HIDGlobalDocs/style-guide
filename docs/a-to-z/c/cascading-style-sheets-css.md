# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Capitalize references to the technique for adding fonts, colors, and so on to web content. Spell out unless the abbreviation *CSS* is familiar to your audience.

Lowercase references to style sheets created using the technique. Don't use *CSS* to refer to a specific cascading style sheet. Instead, use *the CSS file, the cascading style sheet,* or *the style sheet.*
