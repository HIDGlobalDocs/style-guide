# plus sign (+)

Don’t use the plus sign (+) to replace words like *and, over*, and *plus*.

**Exception** Where space is limited, like in UI or a headline, it’s OK to use the plus sign to indicate a count that exceeds a certain number.

## Examples

- HID Signo and HID Mobile Access are better together.  
- 999+ connections (in the UI)
