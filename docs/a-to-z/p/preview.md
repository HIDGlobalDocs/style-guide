# preview

Prerelease versions of software and services are typically identified as *Product Name Preview* (preferred) or *Code Name Preview.* 

In generic references, lowercase *preview.*

Avoid using *beta* to refer to a prerelease product that's ready for unstructured testing by customers. Use *preview* instead.

## Examples

Office 2016 Preview  
Windows 10 Insider Preview  
Microsoft Power BI Preview  
A preview of Azure Container Service is available.
