# flyout

Don’t use in content for a general audience. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do.

It’s OK to use *flyout* as an adjective in content for a technical audience if you need to describe a transient UI element that displays settings or information related to what the customer is doing.

## Examples

- flyout menu  
- flyout message  
- flyout control

Avoid using *flyout* as a noun (for example, “the flyout appears”). Don’t use as a verb (for example, “the menu will fly out”).
