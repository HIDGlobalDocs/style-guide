# flush, flush to

In content for a general audience, don't use *flush, flush to, flush left*, or *flush right* to describe text alignment. Instead, use *even, left-aligned*, or *right-aligned*, as appropriate.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to use *flush* as a verb, for example, *flush the buffer*.
