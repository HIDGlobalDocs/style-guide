# enable, enables

Don't use *enables* (or *allows* or *lets*) to refer to things that HID or HID products make possible for the customer. Rewrite to focus on what's important from the customer's point of view. For example, instead of *HID Linq enables you to create custom and manage reader configurations*, say *Create and manage custom reader configurations with HID Linq*.

Don't use to describe making commands or features available. Use *make available, turn on*, or something similar, or rewrite the sentence.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to describe a feature or command as *enabled*.

It's OK to use *enable the customer to* when you need to refer to the customer in the third person.  

## Example

- Include this control to enable the customer to ....
