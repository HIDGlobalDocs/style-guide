# online services

Avoid. If you need to refer generally to apps and services that you access online, mention the services by name or use *services.* 

Donâ€™t use *online services*
to refer to protocols and data formats, such as XML, SOAP, and WSDL,
that provide the means for integrating web-based apps. Use *web services* instead.
