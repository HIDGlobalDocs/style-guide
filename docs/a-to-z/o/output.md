# output

Don't use as a verb. Instead, use a verb that describes the kind of output, such as *write to,* *display on,* or *print to*.

Avoid using as a noun or an adjective in content for a general audience. Use a more specific term instead.

## Examples

Print a document to a file or to a specific printer.  
The **HttpResponse.Output** property delivers text output to the outgoing HTTP response stream.
