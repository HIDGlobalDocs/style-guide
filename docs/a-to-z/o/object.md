# object

Don't use *object* as a synonym for *item* or *thing*. Instead, refer to a specific object.

For
example, in object-oriented programming, an object is an instance
of a class that contains both methods and data and is treated as one
entity. Similarly, in COM-based technologies, an object is a combination
of code and data that implements one or more interfaces. In
assembly language, *object* refers to the object module, which contains data that has been translated into machine code.
