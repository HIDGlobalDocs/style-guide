# interface

Use only as a noun, as in *user interface* and *application programming interface*. Use *interface* by itself only if the context is clear. 

For a general audience, it's OK to use *UI* or *API* after
spelling out on the first mention. For a technical audience, it's
not necessary to spell out those terms on the first mention.

Don't use *interface* as a verb. Use *interact* or *communicate* instead.

## Examples

The familiar interface helps to minimize training requirements.  
With Skype for Business, you can communicate with your team from wherever you are.
