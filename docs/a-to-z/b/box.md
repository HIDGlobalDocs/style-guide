# box

Most of the time, avoid talking about UI elements. 

When you need to refer to dialog box elements by name, use *box* instead of *field* to refer to any box except a check box or a list box. For a check box, use the complete term, *check box*. For an element that displays a list, such as a drop-down list box, use *list* instead of *box* for clarity.

## Examples

the **Read-Only** box  
the **File Name** box  
the **Hidden Text** check box  
the **Wallpaper** list  

Don't use *box* as a synonym for client and server hardware.
