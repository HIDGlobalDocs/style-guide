# HID Global

Use *HID Global* for the first instance, and *HID* for subsequent instances. Don't use *HID's* or *HID Global's*.

## Examples

- HID software and services  
- HID Signo  
- the HID approach to diversity and inclusion  

**Exception** To avoid awkward wording, it's OK to use *HID's* occasionally when you're referring
to the company itself rather than the trademark or brand name.

## Example

- HID's privacy policies  

Include *HID* the first time you mention a product or service name in body text. When you list several
product names, it's OK to include *HID* before the first name only.

In general, focus on the customer, and avoid making HID the subject of the sentence. For example, say,
"Learn about the options available for upgrading," not "HID offers a variety of options for upgrading." It's OK to use phrasing like *we recommend* if it helps you avoid awkward wording like *it's recommended*.

When it's necessary for HID to be the subject, choose the pronouns that best fit your message.

When the tone is friendly, informative, or inspiring, use *we* and *our*.

## Examples

- We believe in what people make possible.
- We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of the service when it becomes available. 
  
In formal legal or business content, use *it* and *its*.  

## Example

- HID and its subsidiaries  
  
Don't mix pronouns. Don't use *we* to refer to HID and *its* as the possessive pronoun.
