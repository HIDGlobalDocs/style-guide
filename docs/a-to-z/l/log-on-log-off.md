# log on, log off

Don't use *log in, login, log into, log on, logon, log onto, log off, log out, logout,* or a similar term unless it 
appears in the UI (and you're writing instructions). 

Use *sign in* or *sign out* instead.

**See** [sign in, sign out](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/s/sign-in-sign-out.md), [connect](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/c/connect.md)
