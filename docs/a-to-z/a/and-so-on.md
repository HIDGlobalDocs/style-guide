# and so on

Don't use. Instead, be specific. When space is limited, use *such as* or *like* followed by an example or two.

## Example

- Body text is most readable in Times New Roman, Palatino, and other serif fonts. (Not *Body text is most readable in Times New Roman, Palatino, and so on.*)
- Body text is most readable in serif fonts like Palatino.  

Don't use *and so on* to end a phrase that begins with *for example, such as,* or *like.* It's redundant.

## Example

- Body text is most readable in serif fonts, such as Times New Roman and Palatino. (Not *Body text is most readable in serif fonts, such as Times New Roman, Palatino, and so on.*)
