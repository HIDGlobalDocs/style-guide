# application icon, app icon

Don't use to refer to a program icon. Use the specific product name, such as *the* *Word* *icon,* instead. If you must use a general term, use *app icon.*

It's OK to use *application icon* in content for developers when discussing programming elements such as the **ApplicationIcon** property.
