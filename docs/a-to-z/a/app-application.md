# app, application

If possible, refer to a product by its descriptor, such as *database management system* or *spreadsheet.*

Most of the time use *app,* not *application,* to describe desktop apps and cloud apps for tablets and mobile devices. 

**Global tip** The abbreviated form, *app,* isn't available in all languages, so allow enough space for the full translated term in localized content.

For full-featured products, such as Office and Visual Studio, it's OK to use *program* instead of *application.*

It's OK to use *application* in
content for a technical audience, especially to refer to a set of
software files that includes executable files and other components.

Don't use *application program.*
