# number sign (\#)

Always spell out *number* in *number sign*. Don't use *pound sign*.

Don't use the \# symbol preceding a numeral. Spell out *number* instead. For example, use *number 7*, not *\#7*. When space is limited, as in tables, it's OK to abbreviate *number* as *No*.

**Global tip** The abbreviation *No*. isn't used to abbreviate *number* in other languages, so using *No*. for this purpose might lead to mistranslation in machine-translated content.

It's OK to use the \# symbol in references to the \# key on the keyboard.
