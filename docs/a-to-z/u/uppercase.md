# uppercase

Most of the time, use *capital letters* instead of *uppercase.* It's OK to use *uppercase* when comparing with *lowercase* or to follow the UI. 

One word. Don't use *uppercase* as a verb. Don't use *uppercased*. 

When using *uppercase* and *lowercase* together, don't use a suspended hyphen (as in *upper- and lowercase*). Spell out both words instead. 

## Examples

Change all the lowercase letters to uppercase.  
Change the case of both lowercase and uppercase letters.
