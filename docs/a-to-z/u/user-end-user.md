# user, end user

Don't use *end user*. 

Avoid *user* when you can. Use *audience,* *customer*<em>, person, people, employee, coworker,</em> or *you* instead.

It's OK to use *user* in content for developers to distinguish the technology developer from the technology user. It's also OK to use *user* in content for technology professionals to distinguish the system administrator from the system users.
