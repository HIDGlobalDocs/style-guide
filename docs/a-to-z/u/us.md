# US

It's OK to use *US* as an abbreviation for *United States* as an adjective and when space is limited. Spell out *United States* as a noun except when third-party, legally required content specifies otherwise. 

Don't use *USA,* *U.S.,* or *U.S.A.*

If you use the abbreviation, you don't have to spell out *United States* on the first mention.
