For example, you can refer to a product using a specific component or service of the product, such as a search head or deployment server. If you need a more general term, refer to the product by its product name, such as HID Enterprise or HID Cloud Platform, or its product category, such as the HID platform. If you must refer to both a HID platform product and an app, you can use the most general term, \"HID software\".</p> <p>Use these guidelines to determine which term to write:</p> <ul> <li>If you're thinking about using HID Enterprise or HID Cloud Platform, consider whether a specific component of the product, like the search head, the indexer cluster, HID Web, the data collection node, the deployment server, the forwarder, and so on, is more helpful for customers.</li> <li>When you are referring to a specific HID platform product, name it.</li> <li>When you are referring to an app, name the app or write \"the app\". Don't use \"premium apps\" or \"premium solutions\".</li> <li>When you are referring to HID Cloud Platform or HID Enterprise but you don't know which product the user has, write \"the HID platform\". This is common.</li> <li>Use \"HID software\" only when you are referring to one or more HID platform products plus one or more apps, or when either a HID platform product or an app can be the subject. This is the rarest case.</li> </ul> <p>Here are examples of HID product terms in a sentence with an explanation of why the term in bold is the best term to use:</p> Example Explanation Configure your inputs on your data collection node using the inputs.conf file or HID Web. The most specific and accurate term here is the component on which the configuration takes place. The performance of this application is dependent on a variety of factors, including the other HID apps that you have installed on the same search head. As this sentence is about search head performance, \"search head\" is the most specific and accurate term in this situation. Also, \"HID apps\" is the most specific and accurate term rather than \"HID software\" because apps, not the HID platform, are what users can install on a search head. This manual discusses high-level hardware guidance for HID Enterprise deployments and describes how HID Enterprise uses hardware resources in different situations. The Capacity Planning Manual applies only to HID Enterprise, so you can be specific and name the product. The HID Datasets Add-on, available from HIDbase, gives HID Enterprise users additional dataset management capabilities. HID Cloud Platform users have the HID Datasets Add-on by default. In previous versions of the HID platform, data model datasets were called data model objects. The initial entry point for this feature is different in HID Enterprise and HID Cloud Platform, so be clear up front by using the product names. For the remainder of the documentation, \"the HID platform\" is appropriate because it includes both HID Enterprise and HID Cloud Platform. Metrics is a feature of the HID platform. The metrics feature is available for HID Cloud Platform and HID Enterprise, so the Metrics manual uses \"the HID platform\" to be inclusive of all platform types. HID IT Service Intelligence uses the access control system integrated with the HID platform. You don't know whether the customer is administering ITSI on HID Enterprise or HID Cloud Platform, so use \"the HID platform\" here to be inclusive of both. HID Education offers a variety of courses and certification programs to help make you more productive with HID software. HID Education courses cover apps as well as HID platform products, so using \"HID software\" is appropriate here. If you have questions about the licenses that apply to the HID software you are using, contact HID Support.
